A unity feedback system with forward transfer function given below is operating with a
closed-loop step response that has 20% overshoot. 
𝐺(𝑠) = 𝐾 / (𝑠(𝑠 + 7))
a. Evaluate the settling time.
b. Evaluate the steady-state error for a unit ramp input.
c. Design a lag-lead compensator to decrease the settling time by 2 times and decrease the
steady-state error for a unit ramp input by 10 times. Place the lead zero at -3 .
d. Provide root locus plots, pzmap, and comparative step and ramp input responses.
